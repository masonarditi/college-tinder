for this, you need to get XCode and put an open ai api key in your secrets as OPENAI_API_KEY. you also need to setup a firebase database, download your private key and put it in the root directory.

if you're gonna hassle me about committing the plist, don't bother, i know. i'm too lazy to fix it, idc about the db enough. ✌️
